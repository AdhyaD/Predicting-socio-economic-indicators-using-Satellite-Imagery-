# Predicting migration using satellite imagery
Satellite Data Analysis

Development is a much-debated topic in today's world. I perform this research study to understand the development and associated factors more holistically at a finer granularity in a country like India.

This project is an amalgam of statistical and machine learning outputs backed with economic intuition. I inculcate knowledge of computer science and machine learning at every step to solve the problem of policymaking.

With the aim to analyse and establish relationships between different factors that lead to socioeconomic development in a country and internal migration in a country by using statistical tools and find an alternative to the cumbersome task of the census which, happened every ten years by using satellite imagery.

Through this study, we can see that migration within a country is correlated to its development and can also be used to assess its growth.
